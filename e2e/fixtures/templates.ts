// Seeds a real prompt-template file directly into the e2e host's isolated agent dir (bypassing the wire),
// so `template.list`/`template.get` — and the composer's `/` menu (Task B5) — have something real to
// discover. Mirrors `sessions.ts`'s fixture pattern: a pure, re-callable seeding function, called once
// from `globalSetup`. Safe there: per-test `resetState` (`fixtures/app.ts`) wipes `pi-agent/sessions/`, not
// `pi-agent/prompts/`, so this never needs re-seeding mid-suite the way session fixtures sometimes do.

/**
 * A global-scope template (`${agentDir}/prompts/review.md`) with one unfilled positional slot (`$1`, no
 * default — a marker the user must type over) and one prefilled-default slot (`${2:-src/}` — already
 * "src/", tab-through with no typing required), exercising both slot flavors `slotSession.ts` produces.
 * `argument-hint` is quoted: pi's frontmatter is real YAML (the `yaml` package), and an unquoted
 * `[file] [scope]` isn't valid flow-sequence syntax.
 *
 * A second template (`rename.md`) repeats `$1` twice — same positional slot, same `group` — so the
 * composer's Tab-out **group mirroring** (splice the just-filled slot's text into every sibling sharing
 * its group) has something real to exercise: filling the first `⟨name⟩` occurrence and tabbing out must
 * propagate the typed text into the second occurrence without the user typing it twice.
 *
 * A third template (`adjacent.md`) is `$1$2` with no literal text between them and deliberately **no**
 * `argument-hint` at all, so both markers fall back to pi's `arg${n}` naming — `⟨arg1⟩`/`⟨arg2⟩`, 6 chars
 * each — producing two slots with **zero gap**: `slots[0]` is exactly `[0, 6)`, `slots[1]` exactly
 * `[6, 12)`. This is the shape the B5 review's zero-gap boundary bug needed (`slotSession.ts`'s
 * `mapOffset` doc): filling slot 1 with more than one keystroke used to corrupt slot 2's `start`, one
 * character at a time, because a zero-width insert landing exactly on `slots[0].end === slots[1].start`
 * was silently absorbed into the following slot instead of pushing it along.
